title: Introducing to mjt&#39;s AI world
---

Hello to the world, my name is Mjtsai, abbreviated from my Chinese name Meng-Jer Tsai.  Here is the dev-blog of my engineering knowledge gain.  When I am home after work, I kick-off another
session for investigation in the fields of interests, mostly, targeting in artificial intelligence, machine learning where statistic mathematics is the prerequisite, I think really it is.

After several years of review in below academic discipline(with period) :
[1]Calculus(2010.01 ~ 2010.12)   
[2]Linear Algebra(2008.12 ~ 2009.12)   
[3]Probability & Statistics(2011.01.01 ~ 2011.06.17, 2017.01~2017.03)   
[4]Applied Linear Regression Model(2011.06.30 ~ 2011.12.13)   
[5]Matrix Algebra(2011.12.16 ~ 2013.02.27, 2015.05.30 ~ 2016.12.31, 2017.03 ~ 2017.07)   
[6]Computer graphics, 3D transformation, rotation, quaternion(2013.07.04 ~ 2013.07.31, 2013.08.01 ~ 2013.09.18)   

During the period of time, I also do the research with [6] to dump 3D objects and animation build by Blender onto Android phone, and it works.  I can show you why and how in my dev-blog, believe
it or not, I am a part-time Blender arter and can do some simple 3D design both in objects and animation. 

Before the moment I comleted almost all above from [1] to [6], I just had myself involved in machine learning, by Stanford professor ANG CS221 online course in 2011.10.  Due to heavy duty on my daily 
job and some burden from my family, actually, I am a father of two, I left %40 of CS221 uncompleted.  At the meanwhile I think I realize some major topics in [1] to [6], usually, I made some review and
adjust in my handwritings.  It is almost the time, I resume the same course and found it a different world nowadays.  CS221 is now on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).  The 
existing machine learning has become a rather evolutional version, the deep learning.



Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
