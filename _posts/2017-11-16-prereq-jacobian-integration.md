## Jacobian
<p class="message">
Just like lagrange multiplier as a great add-in of constraint in differential to reach the local optimal.  Jacobian is treated as a ratio in between two coordinate system of references transformed in calculus integration process by often.  
Before proceeding any further, take a good look in this article would be quiet helpful.

### What Is Jacobian?
>Begin by a simple example, given $\int_a^bf(x)dx$:  
>If we let $x=h(y)$, take derivation on $y$:  
$$\begin{array}{l}\frac{\operatorname dh(y)}{\operatorname dy}=h^'(y),\;then\\x=h(y)=h^'(y)\cdot\operatorname dy\end{array}$$
