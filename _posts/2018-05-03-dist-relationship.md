## Prologue To The relation in between The Normal, F, Chi-Square, t, Exponential, Poisson Distributions
<p class="message">
The normal, F, chi-square, t, exponential, Poisson distributions are all interconnected, even more the random arrival investigation reveals that the exponential, Poisson distributions are the same for the condition that the very first arrival occurrence after the first arrival interval.  Most of those distributions are developed based on the gamma function.

### Brief Summary
>Here, I am just exhibit the interconnection by graph.
