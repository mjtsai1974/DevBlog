## Neural Network Feedforward Propagation
<p class="message">
Neural network works as a whole to behave like a perceptron, the output from layer $j$ would be mapped by $\theta^{(j)}$</font> to the input of layer $j+1$.  The final output in last layer would then be transformed by 
the logistic regression model to signal the identity of the target object.
