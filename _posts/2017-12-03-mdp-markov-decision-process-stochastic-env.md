## Markov Decision Process In Stochastic Environment
<p class="message">
MDP is a prefered framework in <font color="#EB00EB">stochastic</font> environment and we believe it is full observable.  Due to the outcome of action execution is uncertain and random, action choice should not follow conventional planning, instead, an optimal <font color="#00ADAD">policy</font>.

### Self Design Stochastic Environment
>The most frequently used example is the information space build on the grid world.  This article would just align with world's grid world for MDP.  Alternative illustration of other example would be found in later article in this dev blog.
