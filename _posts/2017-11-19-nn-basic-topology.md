## Neural Network Basic Topology
<p class="message">
Neural network aims at non-linear hypothesis, binary and multiple classification.  In the early 1990, it is believed that it achieves some training hypothesis and come out with results at certain convincible level. 
Due to the fact that it was not scaled very well to large problem at theat moment, it has been placed in the storage and it was almost the time I was a freshman in th euniversity.  Due to H/W calculation and processing
capability has a major improvement in the past two decads, in conjunction with big data science evolution due to open source environment, neural network has been re-inspected, even more, the deep learning has been build
on top of its model representation.  Although his founder Geoff Hilton suspects and claims that backward propagation might not be the most optimal approximation to the way human brain thinkling, which is just like 
the case that jet engines could make human fly but human couldn't fly like a bird.  With full understanding of its model, the way it supports training and recognition would be quiet an add-in in future involve in deep learning.
