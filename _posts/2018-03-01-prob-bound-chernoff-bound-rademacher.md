## Prologue To The <font color="Red">Chernoff Bounds For Rademacher Random Variable</font>
<p class="message">
The <font color="Red">Chernoff bounds</font> is a convenient way to build the shaper bounds in exponential form for <font color="Red">Rademacher</font> random variable.  
It could efficiently relate the sample size to the error bias fits within the desired probability.
