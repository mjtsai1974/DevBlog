title: Chernoff Bounds For Rademacher Random Variable
---

## Prologue To The <font color="Red">Chernoff Bounds For Rademacher Random Variable</font>
<p class="message">
The <font color="Red">Chernoff bounds</font> is a convenient way to build the shaper bounds in exponential form for the <font color="Red">Rademacher</font> random variable.  
It could efficiently relate the sample size to the error bias fits within the desired probability.  
</p>

### The <font color="Red">Rademacher</font> Random Variable
>It is also called the random sign variable.  Let S be a <font color="Red">Rademacher</font> random variable, its events are given $\\{1,-1\\}$, each with probability $\frac {1}{2}$.
