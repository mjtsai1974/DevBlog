## SMO To SVM Addendum
<p class="message">
My support vector machine tourism is not ending over here, but begins to branch to some other fields related to machine learning, reinforcement learning, maybe over a long horizon or soon, back to MDP or POMDP or deep learning.  
The context is all my hand written with the inspiration from many of the on-line lecture in the useful link section.
