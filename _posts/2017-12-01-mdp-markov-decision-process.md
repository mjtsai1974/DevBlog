## Markov Decision Process
<p class="message">
It is the approximation or expression of optimal choice in stochastic environment.  Markov Decision Process is an extension of Markov Chain.  It <font color="red">takes action</font> control between state transition.

### From Markov Chain To Markov Decision Process
>Back to have a glance at the Markov Chain, the future state value might be stablized.  We wonder about the next state from current state, and would like to estimate it out.  The estimation involves one extra consideration of action choice.  The regularized solution would be a policy for each state to take its optimal action to maximize its value over horizon of some magnitude.
