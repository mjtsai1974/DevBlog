title: From Sequential Minimum Optimization To Support Vector Machine

## Prologue To Support Vector Machine
>Given training data set of size $n$, where they are {($x_1$, $y_1$), ($x_2$, $y_2$),...,($x_n$, $y_n$)}, $\forall x_i\in R^d$, $\forall y_i\in\{+1,-1\}$.  
>Supposed these data could be classified and we'd like to learn a <font color="red">hyperplane classifier</font>:  
$$f(x)=sign(w^t\cdot x-b)$$
