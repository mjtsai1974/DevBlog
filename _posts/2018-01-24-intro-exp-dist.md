title: Introduction To The Exponential Distribution

## Prologue To The <font color="Red">Exponential</font> Distribution
<p class="message">
In probability theory and statistics, the <font color="Red">exponential</font> distribution is the model of distribution further developed, base on the most fundamental gamma distribution.  
With the basic realization of gamma distributions, we could also treat the <font color="Red">exponential</font> distribution a <font color="DeepSkyBlue">special case of gamma</font> distribution.  
It would be greatly helpful in the evaluation of the experimental model build on your hypothesis, the power of test for the precision in the machine learning results.
